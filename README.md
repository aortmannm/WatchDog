My first simple tool to observe your windows servers and get mails when something went wrong. You can set different alarm types in the settings.

Features:

- Alarm on RAM Percentage
- Alarm on Free Disk Space
- You can change the interval in Minutes

- In the Mail you will see the current CPU % RAM % and the Space of all available and fixed disks in your Computer.
- You will recive the Event Logs if an Error or Warning is shown
